Vegetation analysis of Mols rewilding project,"A monitoring program was initiated during the 2017 field season in a semi-natural grassland around Molslaboratoriet in National park Mols Bjerge. 22 randomly selected areas for permanent vegetation monitoring (referred to as ExpRewild blocks) were established during early summer in 2017 with each 4 treatment plots and 1 control plot. The different treatments in the programme consist of mowing, all-year exclosure, summer exclosure and winter exclosure. At each plot, one side was delimited for arthropod sampling while the other for the vegetation sampling.",2021-04-14,No citation yet,Diversity analysis,MIT,University of Aarhus,Mols Bjerge National Park,56.23211,10.59313,56.22559,10.56296,"MULTIPOINT ((10.56296 56.22808), (10.5634 56.22818), (10.56577 56.22702), (10.56657 56.22847), (10.56841 56.22855), (10.57157 56.23138), (10.57258 56.23065), (10.57468 56.22783), (10.57473 56.23211), (10.57501 56.23061), (10.57579 56.22798), (10.57758 56.2284), (10.57854 56.22791), (10.57964 56.22926), (10.58399 56.22819), (10.58418 56.22906), (10.5889 56.22712), (10.58913 56.22624), (10.58978 56.22672), (10.59177 56.22571), (10.59193 56.22823), (10.59313 56.22559))",2017-06-03,2020-07-28
